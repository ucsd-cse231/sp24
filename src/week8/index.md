# Week 8: Fer-de-lance

Fer-de-lance, aka FDL, aka **F**unctions **D**efined by **L**ambdas, is an
egg-eater-like language with anonymous, first-class functions.

## Setup

You can use the starter code from github (which might need a bit of work around the implementation of `print`) 
or extend/modify your own code for `egg-eater` as you prefer.

## Your Additions

`fdl` starts with the `egg-eater` and has two significant syntactic changes.  

1. First, it makes function definitions `(defn (f x1 ... xn) e)` a form of *expression* that can be 
   bound to a variable and passed as a parameter,

2. Second, it adds the notion of a `(fn (x1 ... xn) e)` expression 
   for defining anonymous or nameless functions,

```rust
pub enum Expr {
    ...
    Fun(Defn),
    Call(String, Vec<Expr>),
}


pub struct Defn {
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub params: Vec<String>,
    pub body: Box<Expr>,
}
```

For example

```clojure
(defn (f it)
  (it 5))

(let (foo (fn (z) (* z 10))) 
  (f foo)
)
```

```clojure
(defn (compose f g) 
  (fn (x) (f (g x))))

(defn (inc x) 
  (+ x 1))

(let (f (compose inc inc))
  (f input))
```

You can write recursive functions as

```clojure
(defn (f it x)
  (it x))

(defn (fac n) 
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fac (+ n -1)))))

(f fac input)
```

For a longer example, see [map.snek](tests/lam-map.snek) [fold.snek](tests/lam-fold.snek)

## Semantics

Functions should behave just as if they followed a substitution-based semantics. 
This means that when a function is constructed, the program should store any "free" 
variables that they reference that aren't part of the argument list, for use when
the function is called.  This naturally matches the semantics of function values in languages
like OCaml, Haskell and Python.

## Runtime Errors

There are several updates to runtime errors as a result
of adding first-class functions:

- You should throw an error with `arity mismatch` when there is mismatch in the number of arguments at a call.

- The value in function position may not be a function (for example, a user may erroneously
  apply a number), which should trigger a runtime error 
  error that reports `"not a function`.

## Implementation

### Memory Layout

Functions/Closures should be stored in the heap as a tuple

```
-----------------------------------------------
| code-ptr | arity | var1 | var2 | ... | varN | 
-----------------------------------------------
```

For example, in this program:

```clojure
(let* ((x  10)
       (y  12)
       (f  (fn (z) (+ x (+ y z))))) 
  (f 5))
```

The memory layout of the `fn` would be:

```
----------------------------------
|  <address> |  1   | 20  |  24  |
----------------------------------
```

* There is one argument (`z`), so `1` is stored for arity.  

* There are two free variables—`x` and `y`—so the corresponding
values are stored in contiguous addresses (`20` to represent `10`
and `24` to represent 12).  

### Function Values

Function _values_ are stored in variables and registers
as the address of the first word in the function's memory,
but with an additional `5` (`101` in binary) added to the
value to act as a tag.

Hence, the value layout is now:

```
0xWWWWWWW[www0] - Number
0xWWWWWWW[w111] - True
0xWWWWWWW[w011] - False 
0xWWWWWWW[w001] - Pair
0xWWWWWWW[w101] - Function
```

### Computing and Storing Free Variables

An important part of saving function values is figuring out
the set of **free variables** that need to be stored, and
storing them on the heap.  

Our compiler needs to generated code to store all of the
_free_ variables in a function – all the variables that
are used but not defined by an argument or let binding
inside the function.  

So, for example, `x` is free and `y` is not in:

```
(fn (y) (+ x y))
```

In this next expression, `z` is free, but `x` and `y`
are not, because `x` is bound by the `let` expression.

```
(fn (y) (let (x 10) (+ x (+ y z))))
```

Note that if these examples were the whole program,
well-formedness would signal an error that these
variables are unbound.  However, these expressions
could appear as sub-expressions in other programs,
for example:

```
(let* ((x 10) 
       (f (fn (y) (+ x y)))) 
  (f 10))
```

In this program, `x` is not unbound – it has a binding
in the first branch of the `let`.  However, relative
to the `lambda` expression, it is _free_, since there
is no binding for it within the `lambda`’s arguments
or body.

You should fill in the function `free_vars` that returns 
the set of free variables in an `Expr`.

```Haskell
fn freeVars(e: &Expr) -> HashSet<String>
```

You may need to write one or more helper functions
for `free_vars`, that keep track of an environment.  
Then `free_vars` can be used when compiling `Defn`
to fetch the values from the surrounding environment,
and store them on the heap.  

In the example of heap layout above, the `free_vars`
function should return the set `hashset!{"x", "y"}`, and that
information can be used in conjunction with
`env` to perform the necessary `mov` instructions.

This means that the generated code for a `Defn`
will look much like it did in class but with 
an extra step to move the stored variables 
into their respective tuple slots.

### Restoring Saved Variables

The description above outlines how to **store** the
free variables of a function. They also need to be
**restored** when the function is called, so that
each time the function is called, they can be accessed.

In this assignment we'll treat the stored variables
as if they were a special kind of **local variable**,
and reallocate space for them on the stack at the
beginning of each function body.  

So each function body will have an additional part
of the prelude to `restore` **the variables onto the stack**,
and their uses will be compiled just as local variables are.  
This lets us re-use much of our infrastructure of stack
offsets and the environment.

The outline of work here is:

1. At the prelude of the function body, get a reference
   to the function closure's address from which the 
   free variables' values can be obtained and restored,

2. Add instructions to the prelude of each function
   that restore the stored variables onto the stack,
   given this address

3. Assuming this stack layout, compile the function's
   body in an environment that will look up all variables,
   whether stored, arguments, or let-bound, in the correct
   location

The second and third points are straightforward
applications of ideas we've seen already – copying
appropriate values from the heap into the stack, and
using the environment to make variable references
look at the right locations on the stack.

The first point requires a little more design work.  

If we try to fill in the body of `temp_closure_1`
above, we immediately run into the issue of where we
should find the stored values in memory.  

We'd like some way to, say, move the address of the
function value into `rax` so we could start copying
values onto the stack.

But how do we get access to the function value?  

To solve this, we are going to augment the
**calling convention** in Fer-de-lance
to **pass along the closure-pointer** as 
the *zero-th parameter* when calling a function.  

So, for example, in call like:

```
(f 4 5)
```

We would generate code **for the caller** like:

```
mov rax, [rbp-16]  ;; (wherever 'f' is stored)
<code to check that rax is tagged 101, and has arity 2>
push 10            ;; 2nd param = 5
push 8             ;; 1st param = 4
mov rax, [rbp-16]  ;; 
push rax	   ;; 0th param = closure
sub rax, 5         ;; remove tag
mov rax, [rax]     ;; load code-pointer from closure
call rax           ;; call the function
```

Now the function's closure is available on the stack,
accessible just as the 0th argument so we can use that 
in the prelude for restoration.


### Recommended TODO List

1. Move over code from past assignment and/or lecture code to get the basics
   going. There is intentionally less support code this time to put
   less structure on how errors are reported, etc.  Feel free to start
   with code copied from past labs. Note that the initial state of the
   tests will not run even simple programs until you get things started.

2. Implement the compilation of `Defn` and `Call`, ignoring free
   variables. You'll deal with storing and checking the arity
   and code pointer, and generating and jumping over the
   instructions for a function.  Test as you go.

3. Implement `free_vars`, testing as you go.

4. Implement storing and restoring of variables in the
   compilation of `Defn` (both in the function prelude and the place where the closure is created).

5. Figure out how to extend your implementation to support
   recursive functions; it should be a straightforward
   extension if you play your cards correctly in the
   implementation of `Defn` (what should you "bind" the name
   of the function to, in the body of the function?)
